# FEDEM solvers Changelog

## [fedem-8.0.4] (2024-07-12)

### :bug: Fixed

- Issue https://github.com/openfedem/fedem-solvers/issues/3 :
  Not possible to perform stress recovery for more than one part during dynamics solve.

## [fedem-8.0.3] (2024-06-13)

### :rocket: Added

- Source code documentation generated by doxygen/sphinx is automatically built
  whenever a new release tag is pushed, and is published on the github pages
  [here](https://openfedem.github.io/fedem-solvers/).
- Support for L-profiles from PBEAML-records in Nastran bulk data files.
- Account for non-symmetric beam cross sections from Nastran bulk data files.
- An optional `time_next` argument is added to the `start_step()` method
  of the `fedempy.solver.FedemSolver` class, working in the same way as
  the `time_next` argument of the `solve_next()` method.
- The FE part reducer will now continue (with a warning message) when zero-area
  shell elements are detected, instead of aborting the reduction process.

### :bug: Fixed

- The torsional stiffness constant calculated from PBARL/PBEAML records
  is incorrect for some beam cross section shapes.

## [fedem-8.0.1] (2024-01-25)

### :rocket: Added

- The frequency domain solution methods are reinstated,
  using the FFTPACK 5.1 library which now is embedded in this repository.

### :bug: Fixed

- (Cosmetic) A newline follows the object description in the frs-file header.
- Direct curve export from the dynamics solver does not work,
  due do the issue [SAP/fedem-gui#5](https://github.com/SAP/fedem-gui/issues/5).

## fedem-8.0.0 (2023-12-21)

### :rocket: Added

- First open source version of the FEDEM solvers, including a Python API
